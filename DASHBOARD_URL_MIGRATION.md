- **Added**: Redirect from `/` to `/dashboard-home` for backward compatibility
- **Updated**: `/Dashboard` redirect now points to `/dashboard-home`

### 2. Navigation Components

- **Sidebar** (`client/components/healthcare/Sidebar.tsx`): Updated fallback href from `/` to `/dashboard-home`
- **Navigation** (`client/components/healthcare/Navigation.tsx`): Updated Dashboard link to `/dashboard-home`
- **BaseLayout** (`client/components/healthcare/BaseLayout.tsx`): Updated breadcrumb link to `/dashboard-home`

### 5. Documentation

## New URL Structure

### Primary Routes

- **Main Dashboard**: `/dashboard-home` (new primary URL)
- **Root Redirect**: `/` → `/dashboard-home` (automatic redirect)
- **Legacy Redirect**: `/Dashboard` → `/dashboard-home` (automatic redirect)

### User Experience

- Users visiting the root domain (`/`) are automatically redirected to `/dashboard-home`
- All navigation components now point to `/dashboard-home`
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing bookmarks and links

## Benefits

1. **Clear URL Structure**: Explicit dashboard URL makes the application structure more intuitive
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing links and bookmarks continue to work via redirects
3. **SEO Optimization**: Search engines can properly index the dashboard as `/dashboard-home`
4. **Consistent Navigation**: All internal links now point to the same dashboard URL

## Verification Steps

1. Visit `/` - should redirect to `/dashboard-home`
2. Visit `/Dashboard` - should redirect to `/dashboard-home`
3. Click any "Dashboard" navigation link - should go to `/dashboard-home`
4. Check 404 page "Go Home" link - should go to `/dashboard-home`
5. Verify breadcrumb navigation links to dashboard

## Deployment Notes

- No database changes required
- No breaking changes for existing users
- All redirects happen client-side via React Router
- Vercel configuration updated to handle new route structure
